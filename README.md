# Expense-Tracker App

This daily purpose app is created to enable users take note of their everyday expenses. It is not convenient to mark everyday expenses in any notepad or remember everything until the day's end. This pocket friendly web app simply requires a pull and a few swipes to jot down expenses right there in few simple steps. Added benefit, you can simply mention someone's account name and let the person get a reminder of the expense you had with them. 

## To run the app in your local system

Clone the app and in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
